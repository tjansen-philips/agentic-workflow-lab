# Step 11 — Assign Coding agent for a selected issue

**Where you work:** On **GitHub.com**, in the Issue UI.

**What and why:**
Copilot Agents can take an issue, create a branch, and open a draft PR with code changes. This exercise lets you hand off your feature request and observe Copilot’s automation.

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Open the issue you created in Exercise 9
* [ ] Assign it to **Copilot** (Coding Agent)
* [ ] Observe as Copilot opens a branch and draft PR implementing the feature

### 1. Assign the issue to Coding Agent
1. **Open your GitHub repository** in your browser and navigate to the **Issues** tab
2. **Click on the issue** you created in Exercise 9 (e.g., "Add Nutrition Info to Recipe Details")
3. **In the right-hand panel**, look for the **"Assignees"** section
4. **First, assign yourself** by clicking "Assign yourself" - this ensures you'll get notifications and maintain ownership
5. **Then, click the "Assign to Copilot" button** - this adds Copilot as a co-assignee to implement the feature
6. Both you and Copilot should now be listed as assignees

This will trigger the automated workflow where Copilot begins implementing your feature request while you maintain oversight and responsibility for the final outcome.

### 2. Observe the automation

Watch as Copilot opens a branch and draft PR implementing the feature automatically. The Agent follows the patterns defined in your `AGENTS.md` file to ensure code consistency.
