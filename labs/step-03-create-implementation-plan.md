# Step 3: Create an Implementation Plan

Use the planning agent to create a detailed, structured implementation plan.

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Shift+I`)

2. **Choose one of these approaches**:
   
   **Option A - Use the plan agent directly:**
   - Select `plan` from the agent picker in the chat interface
   - Type: `Create an implementation plan for the Task Manager CLI application as described in PRODUCT.md`
   
   **Option B - Use the prompt file:**
   - Type: `/plan-qna Add a Task Manager CLI application for managing tasks`

3. **Answer any clarifying questions** the agent asks about:
   - Feature priorities
   - Implementation details
   - Testing approach

4. **Review the generated plan**:
   - ✅ Follows the `plan-template.md` structure
   - ✅ Breaks down into clear, actionable tasks
   - ✅ Aligns with `ARCHITECTURE.md` design principles
   - ✅ Includes test considerations
